The standings table was a most visit page on the website as thousands of members are looking at where there team sits in the standings on a daily bases. However, the standings table was not responsive and its display all the data values vertically, leaving the page completely illegible. 

I came in this upgrade being inspired by the Score App displays oodles of data in a responsive table that has horizontal scroll. I relied heavily on JavaScript to rebuild a mobile table as I only needed column 3 > onwards to be scrollable. After testing its functionality, I quickly realized that people had no idea that the table was scrollable, so I added an overlay with a message "TAP TO SCROLL" so there no confusion.
